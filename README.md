# Yigit Koray Babal

I am a PhD candidate at Gebze Technical University, Turkey as a member of Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, AxanLab. I completed my MSc (Molecular Biology and Genetics) at the Gebze Technical University and BSc (Biology) at the Marmara University, Turkey.

### Research Interest:

My research focuses on development and use of computational approaches on the neurobiology field. In my MSc thesis, I studied intra-familial regulation of ETS Transcription Factor Family on neurons by using both computational (quantitative kinetic modeling) and molecular (qPCR and Luciferase assay) approaches. My PhD project based on comparison of transcriptomics profiling of neuronal differentiation between different species and gene regulatory network construction under the regulation of ETS transcription factor family. I am currently using computational approaches focused on multi-omics (RNA-seq, Methyl-seq etc.), gene regulatory network inference algorithm and kinetic modeling of gene regulatory networks.
